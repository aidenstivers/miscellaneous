    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> My name is <b>Aiden Stivers</b>, and this is my webpage for LIS 636.
    I am 24-years-old, and I live and work in Louisville, Kentucky.
    I'm originally from Shelby County, Kentucky, where I grew up on
    my family's farm. I attended the University of Louisville for my undergraduate
    degree in Theatre Arts. I focused my studies on performance and props management.
    I also earned a minor in Creative Writing. I wanted to be a poet for most of my life,
    but after getting a job at a public library post-grad, I pivoted towards libraries.
    I also worked at a Starbucks after undergrad, but that was less inspiring.
    I now work full-time at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law as the Circulation
    Manager in their library. It's a fun job! I get to supervise student workers as well as
    manage the circulating collection of books, chargers, etc. In my free time, I enjoy hiking,
    reading, writing, playing games with my friends, picnics, walks, home decor, houseplants,
    dogs, frogs, poetry, vegetables, thrifting, and my boyfriend. I live with my cat, Thistle, who has
    anger management problems. I am queer and transgender. My favorite color is green.</p>

    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p> My career goal is to work as a teen librarian in a public library. I love teen
    programming, young adult literature, and connecting with teens and young adults; I found
    a true passion for public resources and connecting young people with those resources
    during my time working in a public library. I'm currently working in an special academic library,
    and I enjoy it, but find I am not as passionate about it as I would like to be. After a few years here,
    I intend to return to the public library sector.</p>
